# Cyber GRC Portfolio

This repository contains a Cyber Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) portfolio demonstrating risk-based security thinking in a simulated SaaS environment.

The portfolio focuses on identifying, assessing, and managing cyber risks impacting customer data, with an emphasis on governance, proportional controls, and defensible decision-making rather than checklist compliance.

## Portfolio Overview

The portfolio includes the following components:

- **Business Context**  
  A defined SaaS operating environment used to scope risk identification and assessment.

- **Cyber Risk Register**  
  A structured risk register identifying material cyber risks, assessed for likelihood, impact, control effectiveness, and residual risk.

- **Control Mapping**  
  Risk-based mapping of identified risks to relevant controls from ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).

- **End-to-End Case Study**  
  A narrative cyber risk assessment demonstrating methodology, judgement calls, and lessons learned.

## Approach to Cyber GRC

This portfolio applies a pragmatic, risk-based approach to Cyber GRC, focusing on:

- Prioritisation of material risks over exhaustive threat catalogues  
- Selection of proportionate, defensible controls  
- Clear ownership and accountability  
- Use of recognised frameworks as guidance rather than prescriptive checklists


Decisions were made to balance security risk reduction with operational practicality in a mid-size SaaS context.

## Notes

This portfolio is based on a simulated scenario and does not represent a real organisation.  
AI tools were used for drafting and structuring content; all risk assessments, control selections, and judgement decisions were reviewed and refined manually.
