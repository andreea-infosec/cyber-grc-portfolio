      <h2>Cyber Risk Assessment – SaaS Environment</h2>

      <h3>1. Background</h3>
      <p>
        This case study presents a simulated cyber risk assessment conducted for a mid-size SaaS organization
        providing a cloud-based CRM platform.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Scope and Assumptions</h3>
      <p>
        The assessment focused on risks impacting customer data processed within the SaaS platform,
        including identity and access management, third-party integrations, and cloud infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The assessment is based on a hypothetical scenario and is intended to demonstrate Cyber GRC thinking
        rather than represent a real organization.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Risk Assessment Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Risks were identified and assessed using a qualitative risk-based approach, considering likelihood
        and business impact. Existing controls were reviewed to determine control effectiveness and residual risk.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Key Risks Identified</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Credential compromise due to phishing</li>
        <li>Third-party vendor security breach</li>
        <li>Cloud infrastructure misconfiguration</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Control Environment Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The organization has implemented baseline security controls including multi-factor authentication,
        logging and monitoring, vendor due diligence, and cloud configuration management processes.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Gaps and Observations</h3>
      <p>
        While foundational controls are in place, several areas were identified where governance and assurance
        could be strengthened, including consistency of access reviews, ongoing vendor oversight, and monitoring
        of cloud configuration changes.
      </p>

      <h4>Evidence Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        Control effectiveness would be supported through evidence such as access review records, security
        awareness training completion reports, authentication and logging records, vendor risk assessment
        documentation, and cloud configuration review outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        These artifacts would be reviewed periodically as part of assurance or audit activities to validate
        ongoing control operation.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Recommended Actions</h3>
      <p>
        Recommendations were focused on reducing residual risk through proportionate, risk-based improvements,
        including security awareness training, formalised review processes, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Key Judgement Calls</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Limiting the risk register to three risks:</strong>
          Focused on material risks impacting customer data rather than exhaustive threat coverage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintaining a medium residual risk rating:</strong>
          Reflected realistic likelihood of control failure without overstating assurance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoiding mandatory periodic password rotation:</strong>
          Prioritised phishing resistance and detection given MFA implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prioritising governance improvements over additional technical controls:</strong>
          Emphasised consistency, accountability, and monitoring rather than introducing new tools.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9. Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This assessment highlighted the importance of applying a risk-based approach rather than relying solely
        on prescriptive controls or framework checklists.
      </p>
      <p>
        It reinforced the value of clearly defining scope, prioritising material risks, and documenting ownership
        and accountability. The process demonstrated that effective cyber risk management depends as much on
        governance and consistency as on technical controls.
