# Cyber Risk Assessment – SaaS Environment

## 1. Background
This case study presents a simulated cyber risk assessment conducted for a mid-size SaaS organization providing a cloud-based CRM platform.

## 2. Scope and Assumptions
The assessment focused on risks impacting customer data processed within the SaaS platform, including identity and access management, third-party integrations, and cloud infrastructure.

The assessment is based on a hypothetical scenario and is intended to demonstrate Cyber GRC thinking rather than represent a real organization.

## 3. Risk Assessment Methodology
Risks were identified and assessed using a qualitative risk-based approach, considering likelihood and business impact. Existing controls were reviewed to determine control effectiveness and residual risk.

## 4. Key Risks Identified
Three primary cyber risks were identified as most relevant to the organization’s operating model:
- Credential compromise due to phishing
- Third-party vendor security breach
- Cloud infrastructure misconfiguration

## 5. Control Environment Overview
The organization has implemented baseline security controls including multi-factor authentication, logging and monitoring, vendor due diligence, and cloud configuration management processes.

## 6. Gaps and Observations
While foundational controls are in place, several areas were identified where governance and assurance could be strengthened, including consistency of access reviews, ongoing vendor oversight, and monitoring of cloud configuration changes.

## 7. Recommended Actions
Recommendations were focused on reducing residual risk through proportionate, risk-based improvements, including security awareness training, formalized review processes, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

## 8. Key Judgement Calls
Several decisions were made to balance risk reduction with operational practicality, including maintaining a medium residual risk rating and prioritizing governance improvements over additional technical controls.

## 9. Lessons Learned
This assessment reinforced the importance of risk-based decision-making, clear ownership, and aligning controls to both business context and recognised frameworks.
